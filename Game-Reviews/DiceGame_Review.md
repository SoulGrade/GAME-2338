## Summary
### Story
Six adventurers goes to the dungeon controlled by Lady Luck to earn fame and riches, also they are dice.

### Classes
There are six characters the player can choose form each with thier own unique ability and ultimate called "limit break". Limit breaks has a bar that fills up when the player takes damage. All characters have health bars and will go down when receiving damage, if the health bar is fully depleted its game over. 

Characters gain experience by defeating enemies and when they level up their max HP increases and are fully healed and some times gain an exrta dice.

Most characters have an inventory that is an 4X5 box that holds equipment and can equip them in a 2X3 box. The Witch and Jester are the exception and don't gain epuipment insted gain new "spells" or "moves" but they function the same as equipment. 

* **Warrior**-Can reroll his dice. LB(limit break)-doubles the next action.

* **Thief**-Gain an enemie's ability. LB-gains four "1" dices.

* **Robot**-Has a target number, he rolls dice untill the dice is equal to or greater then the target number. If the dice equals to the number, the Robot gains an special ation. LB-Guarantees dice to equal the target number.

* **Inventor**-Has a gadget that can be use without dice but afther each fight the inventor replaces the gadget with a new one made from equipment. LB-Change all dice into "6" dice.

* **Witch**-Assigns "spells" from "1 to 6" dice and must use the corresponding dice number to unlock it first befor "spells" can be use. LB-Gain three dice.

* **Jester**-Has a list "moves" and when a "move" is use is replace with a new "move". The player can see the three next "moves" and can discard two matching "moves" to get two new "moves". LB-Use two mathing "moves" with out dice.

### Game Modes
Each character has 7 game modes called "episodes". 

* **Episode 1: Introduction**-Stantard rules.

* **Episode 2&3: Unique Scenarios**-Special rules are given at the beginning of the run for each character.

* **Episode 4: Elimination Round**-Stantard rules but enemies have 10% more health and their epuipment is upgraded 

* **Episode 5: Parallel Universe**-Everthing but basic mechanics are different.

* **Episode 6: Bonus Round**-Afther every floor a radoom rule is added.

* **Episode 7: Back Stage**-Beat enemies then they become yor allies to defeat Lady Luck.

### Dungeons
Each dungeon is randomly generated and there six levels of a dungeon the player wins the run when they beat the boss on level 6. The dugeon is filled with chests, where the player gains epuiment, anvils, where the player can upgrade their epuiment, shops, where the player can buy epuiment, and food, which heals the player. Also enemies are in the dungeons but the player dosen't have to fight all enemies to reach the next level.

### Battle
Dicey Dungeons has has a turn-base battle system and at the start of the player's turn rolls a set of dice and the dice will determine the player's actions through equiment. Equiment is the main way players interact in battle. Equiment can deal damage, inflict status ailments, heal, amd ect. but all equiment need dice inorder to be use. Some need any dice, some must need odd or even dice, and some need a specific number.

Enemies work the same as the player with their own set of dice and equiment but the also have strengths and weaknesses. When the player defeats an enemy they earn gold and EXP.

## Final Thoughts
I very like how the equiment need dice inorder to be use it is something I haven't seen in a game and adds an element unsurety that you would get in other turn-base battle.
