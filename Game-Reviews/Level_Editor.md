### Rating
I rate this game 4 out of 5 stars.

## Summary
### Game Play
Players will pick a charater form a list of charaters to complete a stage. Stages' can have a variety of ways to complete them from "geting to point A to point B" to "Collecting all coins to complete".

### Characters
There are 11 playable characters, that for the must part have the same controls with Space being an changing ability depending on the character.

**CONTROLS**

* Up - Accelerate

* Down - Reverse

* Left - Lean Left

* Right - Lean Right

* Z - Eject

* Space - Jump, Bost, Brake, or ect.

### Level Editor
Players can create their own stage for a blank template and share to other players and load other player made stages.

* **Shapes**-Create rectangles, circles and triangles.

* **Polygons**-Create alternative to shapes with a maximum of 10 vertices when interactive, and 50 when not.

* **Joints**-Are used to attach one object to another and to add motors to objects.

## Final Thoughts
The level editor is the most injoyable part of Happy Wheels with levels' creativity only limited by the creator's creativity. With hundreds of created levels there are plenty of levels to chose from also levels can be rated so you will know which will be the best.
