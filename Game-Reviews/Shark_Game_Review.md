The 5th installment of the Hungry Shark series released October 18, 2012, created by Future Games of London (FGOL).

### Game Title
Hungry Shark Evolution can be downloaded for free on iOS and Android.

### Rating
I rate this game 3 out of 5 stars .

## Summary
This game is about... this should be at least 3-4 paragraphs summarising the gameplay mechanics of the game. You should be answering the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the game itself.

## Final Thoughts
I like that there are multiple sharks you can choose for and with own unique characteristics but the game play itself I found boring afther a while.
