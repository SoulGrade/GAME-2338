## Summary
### Gameplay
You play as a shark and your objective is to earn has many points by eating smaller creatures or destroying things before you are killed. You have a health bar that steadily decreases when you are not eating smaller creatures or destroying things also you can take damage from hazards but is replenish when eating smaller creatures or destroying things. When your health bar is full displenished it's game over. You as have a boost bar that increase the movement speed of your shark recharges over time. As you play you can earn coins by eating golden fish and chest also when you reach a set amount of points you earn a gold rush where every fish turns into golden fish. You also earn gems when eating unique prey.

### Sharks
Players can unlock sharks with coins or gems and upgrade their strength of bite, boosting speed, and the capacity of boost with coins each with a lv.5 cap. When a shark is use to play they gain level experience and when they level up they increase in size and gain max Hp. All sharks have their own set of missions. You can also buy and equip accessories to your sharks all but a few have different effect on gameplay.

#### Top Secret Lab
Unlocked when a gameplay milestone (a highscore of 500,000 points) is reached this is where buy sharks with unique abilties. Top Secret Lab sharks can't equip accessories.

## Final Thoughts
I like that there are multiple sharks you can choose for and with own unique characteristics but the game play itself I found boring afther a while.
