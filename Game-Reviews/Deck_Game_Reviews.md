## Summary
### Lore
In Magic: The Gathering you play as a "Planeswalker" which are wizards that can travel to differnet worlds and summon creatures form said worlds against an other "Planeswalker"(player).

### Decks
Each deck must have a minimum of 60 cards and can not have more then 4 duplicates of the same card except for lands. Players can earn cards form winning matches and buying 7-card packs with gold. Gold can be earn from completing missions and winning matches. 

There are 7 card types

* **Lands**: Lands come in 5 colors red, blue, green, white, and black. Lands are use to cast other cards, all other cards have a cost to cast most need a specific color. When lands are use to cast a card they become "tap" and when "tap" can't be use to cast cards until your next turn.   

* **Creatures**: Creatures have two numbers on the bottom left of the card, attack(right) and health(left), attack determines how much damage it does and health determines how much damage it takes, it a creature takes damage equal more more then its health then the creature dies. Creatures can attack or block but they can't acttack the same turn they were played and when they do attack they become "tap" and can't attack or block until the player's next turn. Most have abilities. 

* **Sorceries & Instances**: Sorceries & Instances do an action that effects the match in some way. The difference between sorceries & instances is that sorceries can be only be played during its owner's turn while instances can played any time. Afther the action is done sorceries & instances leave the field. 

* **Enchantments & Artifacts**: Enchantments perform an passive action until they leave the field. Artifacts have active actions that cost lands to use.

* **Planeswalkers**: Planeswalkers have multiple abilties but can only use 1 per turn. Planeswalkers come in to play with an loyalty counter that goes up or down depending on the abilty used. When receiving damage the loyalty counter will go down when the loyalty counter reaches 0 the planeswalker leaves the field.

### Battle
