## Summary
**Story**-The story is not directly told to the player. It is up to the player piece the story together form scripted events and hits the game gives.

**Car**-The player contorls a car that is able to Jump, Fly, and drive on walls in order to progress through the stage and to avoid obstacles. The car also has a "Boost" that increases the car's speed but will cause the car to overheat if use continuly. "Checkpoints" resets Boost overheat. When ever the car overheats, crashes, or goes off the track the player will respawn bach to the last checkpoint.

**Arcade**-Arcade has different game modes and came be played solo-play or Multiplayer.

* Sprite-a race to the end of the track.

* Challenge-same as Sprite but with no checkpoints and no respawing.

* Stunt-Perform tricks to earn the highest score.

* Trackmogrify-Random track generation with advanced seed modifiers.

**Level editor**-Players can create levels from within the game and share them.

## Final Thoughts
I like how the car is able to doing multiple things which makes it more intresting then just driving.
