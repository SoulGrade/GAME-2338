## Summary

### The plot
The story takes place in Japan and begains with the protagonist transferring to another high school due to being expelled for a falsely accused crime he did not commit. While on his way to the new school a mysterious app appears onto his phone which leads him parallel dimension called the "Metaverse" which is fill with monsters called "Shadows" this is where the protagonist gains the power of "persona" which allows him to fight against the Shadows. He is able to make it back to the real world and finally makes it to the school where he finds out that a teacher is abusing the students while others turn a blind eye. The protagonist unable to turn a blind eye he vows to not let anyone corrupt get away without facing jastice and with the help of others and the Metaverse is able to change the heart of the corrupt and make them confess thier own crimes.

### Game Mechanics
**World**: The world is broken up into different areas and over time more areas will open up. The player can explorer, buy items, or spend time. The day can be split into afternoon and eveing where some events can only occurring in either afternoon or eveing. 

**Social Links**: The protagonist will have relationships with the other PCs and unique NPCs called Social Links where the play will learn about that character's story. Each link has ten ranks and with each rank complete the player gain more abilities, bonuses, and items.

**Personas**: Personas allows the PCs to use skills in battle. Each PC ,except the protagonist, has only one persona. Each persona has their own set of strengths and weaknesses and skills. To obtain new personas you can "Fuse" two or more personas you onw to make a new persona or you can make Shadow into your personas. You can buy back any persona you onw via the "Persona Compendium" 

**Metaverse**:In th Metaverse there are dungeons called Palaces which are filled with enemies(Shadows) and items and if the player can not bet the dungeon's boss in a certain amount of time it's game over.

**Battle**: Turn base battle system where speed determines who goes first. The player controlls a team with a max of four PCs where they give demands to attack, guard, run away, use items or skills. The protagonist will always be in the team and is able to have multiple personas but can switch only once per turn. Whenever a PC or enemie hits a characters' weakest they gain an extra action. Also the player can equip PCs with equipment to increase their stats.

## Final Thoughts
I haved always like the compendium not only does it make getting personas convenient it also give lore of the personas because personas are base on mythical creatures from different cultures around the world and lern more about them has always interest me. One thing I miss is when you complete all Social Links in one playthrough you can unlock the true ending they did this for the Persona 4 but in persona 5 you can still get the true ending even though you didn't complete all Social Links so there is't any real reward for completing all Social Links in one playthrough.
