# How Bungie Test
Every body test; arties, designers, and sound guys test. They teats by seeing what then added into the game works. Dedicated test team working in studio from day one. Takes about three years of testing a game. 

## Functionality Testing
Needs to test that everything works; guns, players spanw, UY. Trying to find ways to crash the game. Developers need a functional build to work on. 

## User Ability Testing
A group of psycholoigist dedicated to find user data one person at a time. Getting into the mind of the player and finding out how do they feel about the level or game features.

### Play Testing
Broader sample, multiple players. The developer don't not know how a player will play their game. Getting data on bugs and what's fun and not fun. Can find user data on a map with data points where they can click on the point to see how the player die or got stuck and what they found frustrating.

A lot more variables to test, hours of automation testing require for Xbox live. 

## Bug Testing
"Triage" deciding what bugs to fix and when you fix a bug there is a chance to make more bugs by fixing one bug. Content is being added along with bugs. Not all bugs can't be fix in a reasonable time.
